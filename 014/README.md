The Problem
Write a class Pet that is derived from the Animal class

In addition to the type* and food* variables, Pet should have a private variable name* and private variable owner_name*.
Write functions that get and set the type of food*, name*, and owner*name* of the Pet class. Follow the naming scheme of the other getters and setters.
Write a function print that returns the string "My name is NAME" where NAME is the value of the name* variable.
Write a default constructor for Pet that initializes type* to cat, food* to "fish", name* to "Fluffy", and owner*name* to "Cinda" and a constructor that takes in the type of animal, type of food, name, and owner name as parameters.
Testing Your Code
There is a main function in main.cpp that produces the following output:

I am a cat
My name is Garfield
